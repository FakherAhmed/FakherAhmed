Hi, I'm Fakher Ahmed — an Applied Physicist (M.Sc.) at the forefront of research and development, pushing the boundaries of product and process optimization.
My passion lies in the synergy between physics and data, driving me into the dynamic world of data science. 
I thrive on turning complex datasets into actionable insights, combining theory with hands-on application.

I recently started GitHub to share both open-source practice projects and private projects, refining my skills across various domains and collaborating with like-minded individuals.
Let’s connect and explore how my interdisciplinary expertise can bring value to our shared professional goals! 🚀🔬💻
